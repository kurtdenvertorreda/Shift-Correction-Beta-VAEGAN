I have a dataset in a folder containing 100 SVC files.
Each SVC file represents a time series drawing of a clock.
The drawings are sampled at 100 points per second.
The length of each time series varies because different users draw at different speeds (some draw quickly, while others draw slowly).
Consequently, each SVC file has a different number of rows (i.e., data points).
Columns in Each SVC File:

Each SVC file contains columns: x, y, timestamp, pen_status, pressure, azimuth, and altitude.
I am primarily interested in using the x, y, and pen_status columns for training.
Augmented Data Generation Goal:

When generating augmented data, I want the output to resemble a new clock drawing that captures the common characteristics learned from all 100 files.
The augmented data should have similar properties to a single handwriting task, as if a new user is drawing a clock.
